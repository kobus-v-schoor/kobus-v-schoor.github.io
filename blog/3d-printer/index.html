For some unknown
reason I even thought that I could do it cheaper than buying a commercial
printer. Skip a few months ahead, and in a euphoric frenzy I was printing a
semi-random deposit of filament on a skew bed. These days the printer is
actually useful and printing Benchies to my heart&rsquo;s content. In this post I&rsquo;ll
take you through the process I went through to design and build my printer. It
won&rsquo;t be a detailed build guide but rather just my experience (and maybe a bit
of a cautionary tale) of building my own 3D printer, from scratch.</p><h2 id=starting-with-the-basic-design>Starting with the basic design</h2><p>Before I could go ahead I needed to make a few basic choices regarding the
design of the printer. After some Google-fu and watching countless YouTube
videos I decided on the following:</p><ul><li>It was going to be a Cartesian printer (i.e. it moves straight along the x, y
and z-axis)</li><li>I was going to use a Bowden style extruder</li><li>That I&rsquo;m going to design and build my own DIY controller</li><li>It would have at least a 20cm x 20cm x 20cm printing volume</li></ul><p>Exactly one of these worked out (it stayed a Cartesian printer).</p><h2 id=doing-the-cad-designs>Doing the CAD designs</h2><p>When I first started working on this project I had no idea how to design CAD
models. Suffice it to say, this was not the easiest project to learn
CAD with. But, eventually I got going using FreeCAD, a wonderful FOSS CAD
solution that I still use for all my CAD&rsquo;ing needs. I initially started drawing
up models of all the bought components (stepper motors, pulleys, rods etc.)
after which I started with my own part designs.</p><p>Now at this point I didn&rsquo;t have access to my own printer so all the printed
parts had to be printed somewhere else, which made prototyping a lot harder to
do. After my first 7-hour long print, I excitedly took the rod and tried to
push it in one of the mounting holes. This is the exact moment that I learned
about tolerances. As you could probably guess, it didn&rsquo;t fit (including the
other parts). So, back to the drawing board - after several prototype
iterations the first parts started coming to life and soon enough I had some
basic parts going.</p><p>For those interested, all my FreeCAD design files can be found in this <a href=https://github.com/kobus-v-schoor/printer>Github
repo</a> (I&rsquo;m warning you now, don&rsquo;t
expect much).</p><figure class=figure style=transform:rotate(0)><a class="stretched-link zoom-link" href=/blog/3d-printer/first-part.jpg><i class=zoom-icon data-feather=zoom-in></i></a>

Size does matter.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=printing-the-parts>Printing the parts</h2><p>The time I learned most about 3D printing was while I was printing my own
printer. I learned a lot about warping (the printer I was initially using had
no heated bed), tolerances, skipped steps and all those other fun things they
never show to you. Since I had to print parts one-by-one on a printer I didn&rsquo;t
own this initial printing phase took weeks to finish. I&rsquo;d set up a print to go
overnight, get it the next day and test it. If it worked I&rsquo;d set up the next
print on the following day. To make things more interesting, at this point in
time our country had daily power interruptions - these don&rsquo;t tend to go great
with long-running prints. Piece-by-piece it was starting to resemble a 3D
printer.</p><figure class=figure style=transform:rotate(0)><a class="stretched-link zoom-link" href=/blog/3d-printer/first-steps.jpg><i class=zoom-icon data-feather=zoom-in></i></a>

Printed partially in ABS for the parts that are exposed to heat (the ugly beige parts).</figcaption></figure><h2 id=wiring-it-all-up>Wiring it all up</h2><p>Things were coming together, and I finally got to the point where I could
connect things to each other. Except, I didn&rsquo;t have a controller. Now you might
remember my initial goal of developing my own controller. At this point I had a
few months of sobering reality sinking in and I realized that I actually want
to build a printer that works. So, I gave in and went ahead and bought a RepRap
controller. To this day I&rsquo;m very grateful that I did this - at that point in
time I didn&rsquo;t even know what a PID controller was. You could probably guess how
my controller would have turned out.</p><p>I hooked it all up and was ready for the big eureka moment. It was 1 AM in the
morning and I was ready to print my first Benchy.</p><figure class=figure style=transform:rotate(0)><a class="stretched-link zoom-link" href=/blog/3d-printer/wiring.jpg><i class=zoom-icon data-feather=zoom-in></i></a>

fresh in my memory. The stepper motor drivers were pushing way too much
current, causing the whole rig to vibrate and scream as if I was torturing it.
The X-axis stepper motor jumped and rammed the hotend into the side of the
printer (who needs limit switches wired up this early in a project?). Needless
to say I was overjoyed that it was alive and well. Fearing that it would
destroy its own printing bed, the first print happened entirely in mid-air. It
was glorious (and severely under-extruding as I would later find out).</p><div class="mb-3 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class=embed-responsive-item src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U7DQTpvaS9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="mb-3 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class=embed-responsive-item src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FrNkTUN_kyU?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id=countless-hours-of-tuning>Countless hours of tuning</h2><p>This was probably one of the phases where progress was the slowest. At this
point I had no bed levelling, the Z-axis was constantly becoming skew and I was
only beginning to learn that 3D printing was actually not such straight-forward
process. After finally getting the stepper motor current just right, there was
still the steps per mm, printer limits, bed levelling, Z-axis levelling and
extrusion speed to figure out. It started out with a measly 1cm cube, moving up
to the famous calibration cube and finally, Benchy was on the way. It took
multiple tries before I got the printer to finally stop skipping steps on the
hull, and then, there it was in all its glory (and printing imperfections). The
printer still had severe ringing issues, inconsistent extrusion and every now
and then it was skipping steps. But it was printing (and not catching on fire,
which was a rather big worry for me at the time).</p><figure class=figure style=transform:rotate(0)><a class="stretched-link zoom-link" href=/blog/3d-printer/benchy.jpg><i class=zoom-icon data-feather=zoom-in></i></a>

I was able to
get out basic parts, and I finally started printing parts for the printer <em>on
itself</em>. It became abundantly clear that I would have start doing some upgrades
to the printer. Over the coming weeks I performed the following upgrades:</p><ul><li>I switched over to a direct extruder - the Bowden setup was causing too many
issues and it had inconsistent extruding.</li><li>I changed the Z-axis to use two separate drivers and limit switches. This
allowed automatic Z-levelling using the wonderful Marlin firmware. Before
this the Z-axis would constantly become skew, leading to all sorts of weird
and wonderful printing issues.</li><li>Automatic bed-levelling using a BL Touch sensor. I spent literal hours trying
to get the bed properly levelled, only to have it become skew after only a
few days. This lead to prints detaching or coming out wrong.</li><li>A cooling fan attached to the hotend mount which really tidied up the prints
and helped with bridging.</li><li>A housing for the controller. I consider this an upgrade because it the
printer was technically working fine without it.</li><li>Added an LCD screen with an SD-card reader, because printing directly from my
laptop was quickly getting old.</li></ul><h2 id=wrapping-it-all-up>Wrapping it all up</h2><p>It has now been almost two years since that first fateful print, and the
printer is still going strong. I&rsquo;ve printed through quite a few kilograms of
filament and some of the parts are starting to show their age, but after all the
gradual upgrades and tweaks it has become quite reliable. These days I almost
never have a failed print and the printing quality has stayed relatively good.
In the end the printer probably ended up costing more than 3 times the price of
a comparable commercial printer, but if I had to do it again I&rsquo;ll choose the
DIY route every time. I learned a ton in the process, had a lot of fun and
printed more Benchies than is probably healthy (I have a giant plastic bag full
of them just lying around somewhere).</p><p>The printer ended up having close to the original design volume (17cm x 18cm x
18cm) and overall the print quality is quite good. It can&rsquo;t print very fast
however, doing so results in ringing or missed steps. I&rsquo;ve printed everything
from project enclosures to pot handles in PLA, ABS, Wooden filament and even
flexible TPU.</p><p>For anyone considering building their own printer, I&rsquo;d have to warn you that
its not going to be a quick build. The fine-tuning process takes forever, and
hunting down all the myriad of printer issues you&rsquo;ll face is no small
challenge. However, it taught me more about 3D printing than I would ever have
learned otherwise and was probably the most fun I&rsquo;ve had working on an
electronics project in years. If you got this far, thank you for reading! And
may your Benchies always come out perfectly.</p><figure class=figure style=transform:rotate(0)><a class="stretched-link zoom-link" href=/blog/3d-printer/printer.jpg><i class=zoom-icon data-feather=zoom-in></i></a>
